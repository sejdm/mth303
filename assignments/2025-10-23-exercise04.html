<li><p>Prove (from the axioms) the symmetry, reflexivity, and transitivity of = in first order logic.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> be a well formed formula, and assume that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \vdash \alpha&#39;\)</span>, then prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \alpha \vdash \forall x \alpha&#39;\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha&#39;\)</span> be well formed formulae such that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \vdash \alpha&#39;\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> a term, and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> a variable. Choose a variable <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> that does not occur in <span class="math inline">\(\alpha&#39;\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall y \alpha \vdash \forall z (\alpha&#39;)^y_{z}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> denote a consistent set of well formed formulae. Prove that <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\cup \{\neg \forall x \alpha \to \neg \alpha^x_c \}\)</span> is consistent where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is a constant symbol that has not been used before. Extend the proof to the union of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> with countably many well formed formulae of the form <span class="math inline">\(\neg \forall x \alpha \to \neg \alpha^x_c\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that to show that <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\vDash \alpha\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma \vdash \alpha\)</span> is equivalent to showing that any consistent set of well formed formulae is satisfiable.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, \ldots\)</span> denote variables in a first order language, then will the set <span class="math inline">\(\{\forall x_1 P x_1, Px_2, Px_3, \ldots\}\)</span> be satisfiable and / or consistent?</p></li>
