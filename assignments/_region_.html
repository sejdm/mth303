<p><span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> with countably many well formed formulae of the form <span class="math inline">\(\neg \forall x \alpha \to \neg \alpha^x_c\)</span>.</p>
<p>Prove that to show that <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\vDash \alpha\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma \vdash \alpha\)</span> is equivalent to showing that any consistent set of well formed formulae is satisfiable.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, \ldots\)</span> denote variables in a first order language, then will the set <span class="math inline">\(\{\forall x_1 P x_1, Px_2, Px_3, \ldots\}\)</span> </p>
