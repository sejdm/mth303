<p><span class="math inline">\(p_0, p_1, \ldots\)</span> that is consistent and a proposition <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(p_0, p_1, \ldots \vdash q\)</span>, is it true that the sequence <span class="math inline">\(q, p_0, p_1, \ldots\)</span> is also consisent?

<p>Prove that for any propositional forms <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(p \implies q\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> can be derived from <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> by an inference rule), then <span class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is a tautology. You will have to check this for each of the inference rules.</p>
